# art-supply-tracker
Mobile first redesign and implementation of artsupplytracker using React and JavaScript.

I worked on this project with the concept of a mobile-first web application that tracks your art supplies.
You would be able to fill your collection on your laptop, then pull it up while shopping at the art store for reference.

I designed the project's layout using Figma, focusing on mobile design layouts first as that would be the primary platform.
You can view the original design at [https://www.figma.com/design/0LxqJbBWnw07SKJpn5pTVx/Art-Supply-Tracker--Mobile-?node-id=0-1&t=oPrP1F93Lq8DYO0G-1](https://www.figma.com/design/0LxqJbBWnw07SKJpn5pTVx/Art-Supply-Tracker--Mobile-?node-id=0-1&t=oPrP1F93Lq8DYO0G-1).

I implemented authentication using Firebase, including an automatic email sign in link if you forget your password,
validation for when someone tries to create an account with an email that already exists, and so on.

After taking an advanced web development course during my Computer Science BS, I learned a lot more about Firebase, React, Node, and Express, and reimplemented this project in a more polished way, adding additional features and a database. 

The first version used a SQL database, Node, and Express, which you can find at [creative-project](https://github.com/roryhackney/creative-project).
The second version used a JSON database, React, and Firebase, which you can find at [creative-project-react](https://github.com/roryhackney/creative-project-react).
